#Conclusion:At the 90% confidence level, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating a significant relationship between household income levels and age differences in couples. Specifically, as the income midpoint increases, the age difference between partners decreases, suggesting a negative relationship. This supports the hypothesis that different age groups in the labor force exhibit significant differences in age gaps compared to those not in the labor force.

# Part b: Hypothesis Test on Income Levels and Age Differences in Couples

# Hypothesis Test
# Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no relationship between income levels and age differences in couples.
# Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a relationship between income levels and age differences in couples, with labor force status influencing age gaps.

# t-stat: 14.560 
#p-value: <2e-16
#Conf int: (-3.896278e-01) , (-3.105302e-01)

# Conclusion:
#At the 90% confidence level, examine if the confidence interval for `income_midpoint` excludes zero. A significant p-value and confidence interval excluding zero suggest that income influences age differences among couples in the labor force. Since the p-value is extremely small, the t-statistic is large, and the confidence interval does not contain zero, we reject the null hypothesis. This means we have strong evidence to conclude that women do not use food stamps more than men.

#Results
```{r Question 1c}
#Null Hypothesis: Women use food stamps at a higher rate than men.
#H₀: w > m

#Alternative Hypothesis: Women do not use food stamps more than men.
#H₁: w ≤ m


#this is a left tailed test 

#confidence interval is 95% 

#z-score is -1.645

#the t stat must be less than or equal to the z score. 

#2e-16 is greater than -1.645. 

#P-vaLue: < 2e-16 
#T-stat: -9.796
#Confint: [-0.3972, -0.3029]

#Conclusion: Since the t-stat is greater than the z-score, we must fail to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, women do use more food stamps than men.

```{r Question 2}

#When searching for articles, I specifically focused on those in JSTOR that utilize econometric models.

#1) "Who is 'Most Valuable'? Measuring the Player's Production of Wins in the National Basketball Association" by David J. Berri
https://www.jstor.org/stable/3108257

This article utilizes NBA player data from the 1994-1998 seasons to construct an econometric model that links individual player statistics to team wins. The data, which includes per-game averages of points scored, rebounds, assists, and other performance metrics, is publicly accessible through NBA aggregated statistics. Berri employs a linear regression model, comparing it with the more commonly used Cobb-Douglas function, to estimate each player’s marginal contribution to team wins. His model focuses on identifying players' true productivity by controlling for external factors like team tempo and opponent strength, answering the core question: Which player statistics are most influential in driving team success?


#2) "The Effect of Performance of Soccer Clubs on Their Stock Prices: Evidence from Turkey" by Ender Demir and Hakan Danis
https://www.jstor.org/stable/41343433

This article uses data from Turkish soccer clubs (Besiktas, Galatasaray, and Fenerbahce) listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange from their listing dates through the 2008/2009 season to examine how match outcomes affect stock prices. The data, including stock prices, match results, and betting odds, is publicly accessible via market reports and sports databases. Demir and Danis employ a regression model, with abnormal stock returns calculated using a market model benchmarked against the Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 index. This approach isolates the effect of match outcomes by controlling for market-wide movements on match days. The study addresses the core question: How do different match outcomes (win, loss, or draw) influence stock prices, and does this impact vary between domestic and European matches?
