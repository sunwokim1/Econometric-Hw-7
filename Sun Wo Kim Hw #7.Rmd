# Hypothesis Tests and Analysis of Age Difference and Income Levels in Couples
 
#Hypothesis Test Setup
# Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no relationship between income levels and age differences in couples in the labor force.
# Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a relationship between income levels and age differences in couples, where higher income levels are associated with different age gaps.
# The significance of the relationship will be tested at the 90% confidence level.

# Subgroup Analysis:
#This analysis aims to examine the relationship between income levels and age differences reported by couples, focusing on household income and age.Specifically, we investigate whether different age groups in the labor force exhibit larger age gaps in their relationships compared to those who are not in the labor force. We will use a 90% confidence level for statistical tests to determine if income levels significantly predict age differences in couples.

# Step 1: Calculate the age difference between couples
acs2021_couples <- acs2021_couples %>%
  mutate(age_diff = AGE - h_age)

# Verify age difference by summarizing age data for female-male couples
summary(acs2021_couples$AGE[(acs2021_couples$SEX == "Female") & (acs2021_couples$h_sex == "Male")])
summary(acs2021_couples$h_age[(acs2021_couples$SEX == "Female") & (acs2021_couples$h_sex == "Male")])

# Step 2: Create income midpoint categories to classify household income levels
# This provides a more interpretable scale for income in the analysis.
acs_subgroup <- acs2021_couples %>%
  mutate(income_midpoint = case_when(
    HHINCOME < 25000 ~ 12500,
    HHINCOME >= 25000 & HHINCOME < 35000 ~ 30000,
    HHINCOME >= 35000 & HHINCOME < 50000 ~ 40000,
    HHINCOME >= 50000 & HHINCOME < 75000 ~ 62500,
    HHINCOME >= 75000 & HHINCOME < 100000 ~ 82500,
    HHINCOME >= 100000 & HHINCOME < 150000 ~ 125000,
    HHINCOME >= 150000 & HHINCOME < 200000 ~ 175000,
    HHINCOME >= 200000 ~ 225000,
    TRUE ~ NA_real_  # Handle missing income cases
  ))

# Step 3: Filter for labor force participants
# Subset data to include individuals aged 25-85 who are active in the labor force (worked more than 4 weeks and at least 35 hours per week).
acs_subgroup1 <- acs_subgroup %>%
  filter(AGE >= 25 & AGE <= 85, WKSWORK2 > 4, UHRSWORK >= 35)

# View the filtered dataset for verification
#View(acs_subgroup1)



# Step 4: Fit a linear model to test the relationship between income levels and age difference
model_1 <- lm(age_diff ~ income_midpoint, data = acs_subgroup1)
summary(model_1)
confint(model_1, level = 0.90)

#Results:
#The coefficient for `income_midpoint` will indicate whether there is a statistically significant relationship between income and age difference. If the 90% confidence interval for `income_midpoint` does not include zero, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude a significant relationship.

# Step 5: Visualize the Relationship between Age Difference and Income Midpoint
# Use a 10% random sample to make the plot clearer and less crowded
set.seed(12345)  # Set seed for reproducibility
NNobs <- nrow(acs_subgroup1)
graph_obs <- (runif(NNobs) < 0.1)  # Randomly select 10% of observations
dat_graph <- subset(acs_subgroup1, graph_obs)  # Subset for plotting

# Plotting age difference vs. income midpoint with jitter for clearer visualization

  geom_point(color = "darkgrey", alpha = 0.4) +

  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Income and Age Difference in Couples",
    x = "Income Midpoint",
    y = "Age Difference (Years)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Conclusion:
# At the 90% confidence level, examine the p-value for `income_midpoint` and the confidence interval. If `income_midpoint` is significant, it suggests that income levels do indeed influence age differences in couples in the labor force. We conclude that income levels may play a role in the age dynamics of couples, potentially influenced by labor force participation.

#Results
```{r Question 1d}
#Null Hypothesis: Women use food stamps at a higher rate than men.
#H₀: w > m

#Alternative Hypothesis: Women do not use food stamps more than men.
#H₁: w ≤ m


#this is a left tailed test 

#confidence interval is 95% 

#z-score is -1.645

#the t stat must be less than or equal to the z score. 

#2e-16 is greater than -1.645. 

#Conclusion: Since the t-stat is greater than the z-score, we must fail to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, women do use more food stamps than men.

```{r Question 2}

#When searching for articles, I specifically focused on those in JSTOR that utilize econometric models.

#1) "Who is 'Most Valuable'? Measuring the Player's Production of Wins in the National Basketball Association" by David J. Berri
https://www.jstor.org/stable/3108257

This article utilizes NBA player data from the 1994-1998 seasons to construct an econometric model that links individual player statistics to team wins. The data, which includes per-game averages of points scored, rebounds, assists, and other performance metrics, is publicly accessible through NBA aggregated statistics. Berri employs a linear regression model, comparing it with the more commonly used Cobb-Douglas function, to estimate each player’s marginal contribution to team wins. His model focuses on identifying players' true productivity by controlling for external factors like team tempo and opponent strength, answering the core question: Which player statistics are most influential in driving team success?


#2) "The Effect of Performance of Soccer Clubs on Their Stock Prices: Evidence from Turkey" by Ender Demir and Hakan Danis
https://www.jstor.org/stable/41343433

This article uses data from Turkish soccer clubs (Besiktas, Galatasaray, and Fenerbahce) listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange from their listing dates through the 2008/2009 season to examine how match outcomes affect stock prices. The data, including stock prices, match results, and betting odds, is publicly accessible via market reports and sports databases. Demir and Danis employ a regression model, with abnormal stock returns calculated using a market model benchmarked against the Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 index. This approach isolates the effect of match outcomes by controlling for market-wide movements on match days. The study addresses the core question: How do different match outcomes (win, loss, or draw) influence stock prices, and does this impact vary between domestic and European matches?
